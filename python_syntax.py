#Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a personâ€™s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.

# create the initial variables below
age = 28
sex = 0
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0

# Add insurance estimate formula below
insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Age Factor
age += 4

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(new_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost 

print ("The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# BMI Factor
age = 28
bmi += 3.1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(new_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost 

print ("The change in cost of insurance after increasing the BMI by 3.1 is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Male vs. Female Factor
bmi = 26.2
sex = 1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(new_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost 

print ("The change in estimated cost for being male instead of female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")



# Extra Practice

sex = 0
smoker = 1

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(new_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost 

print ("The change in estimated cost for being a smoker instead of non-smoker is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")


smoker = 0
num_of_children = 7

new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(new_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost 

print ("The change in estimated cost for having 7 instead of 3 kids " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
